<node CREATED="1329950529448" ID="ID_1437337960" MODIFIED="1329996616168" POSITION="right" TEXT="Tired of hearing Mitt Romney crow about his record of balancing the budget while governor of Massachusetts, Rick Santorum delivered what may have been the best zinger of Wednesday night&apos;s CNN debate in Arizona.&#xa;&#xa;By Romney&apos;s implication, Santorum said, former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis -- a liberal bogeyman -- is qualified to be president.&#xa;&#xa;&quot;Yes, you balanced the budget for four years, off a constitutional requirement to balance the budget for four years. No great shakes,&quot; said Santorum. &quot;I&apos;d like to see it federally. But don&apos;t go around bragging about something you have to do. Michael Dukakis balanced the budget for 10 years. Does that make him qualified to be president of the United States?&quot;&#xa;&#xa;Dukakis led Vice President George H.W. Bush until late in the 1988 presidential election, when Bush overtook him to win the White House.&#xa;&#xa;Romney, meanwhile, deployed a creative way of giving Santorum the credit/blame for President Barack Obama&apos;s health care law: If he hadn&apos;t endorsed Arlen Specter in 2004, he never would have been in the Senate to switch parties and ultimately vote in favor of Obamacare.&#xa;&#xa;Santorum responded as he always has: He backed Specter, he said, only after Santorum won from Specter a promise that he would not block pro-life Supreme Court justices as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The resulting confirmations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito vindicated him, Santorum said.&#xa;&#xa;Romney insisted that such an explanation was &quot;torturous.&quot;&#xa;&#xa;&quot;Just about as torturous as six years later blaming me for Obamacare,&quot; Santorum quipped.">

True, it wasn&apos;t the sort of decisive drubbing he delivered in Florida, when he similarly needed a comeback against a then-surging Newt Gingrich. True, it&apos;s shocking Romney was ever as endangered as he was in the state where he grew up and his father was a popular governor. But Santorum bet it all on his Michigan model -- he argued that he could win Rust Belt states by appealing to a combination of rural social conservatives and blue-collar whites, and by doing so, prove his general-election viability. Instead, his weaknesses were on glaring display: He spent the last week before the primary reeling from a subpar debate performance and getting painted into an ever more extreme social-conservative corner. He called those who would send kids to college &quot;snobs&quot; and said President Kennedy -- the man who blazed a trail in presidential politics for Catholics like Santorum -- made him want to &quot;throw up.&quot; Next to those kind of profoundly unappealing sentiments, Romney&apos;s cheery reference to owning a couple of Cadillacs looks positively innocuous.   Though Romney looked relaxed and natural in his speech Tuesday night, he still does not look like anybody&apos;s idea of a solid, consensus front-runner. But if he&apos;s still vulnerable in the primary, to whom or what is he vulnerable? Santorum, like Gingrich before him, now looks like severely damaged goods. His wan, halfhearted Tuesday night speech suggested that he knew it. Santorum was right: A lot of people who didn&apos;t know who he was a month ago do now. The question is how many like what they see.">
